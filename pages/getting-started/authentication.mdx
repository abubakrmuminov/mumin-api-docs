# Authentication

The Mumin API uses **API Keys** to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.mumin.ink).

## Getting an API Key

1.  Log in to your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.mumin.ink).
2.  Navigate to the **API Keys** section.
3.  Click **Create New Key**.
4.  Copy the key immediately. It looks like `sk_mumin_...`.

<Callout type="warning">
  Your API key carries many privileges, so be sure to keep it secure! Do not
  share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub,
  client-side code, and so forth.
</Callout>

## Authentication Header

Authenticate your API calls by including your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer sk_mumin_YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example

```bash
curl https://api.hadith.mumin.ink/v1/hadiths/random \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_mumin_123456789"
```

<Callout type="error">
  Requests without a valid API key will return a `401 Unauthorized` error.
</Callout>
