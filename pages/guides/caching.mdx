# Caching Strategies

Caching is crucial for high-performance applications. Since hadith texts generally do not change, you can cache them aggressively to improve speed and save API credits.

## Server-Side Caching

The API sends `ETag` and `Cache-Control` headers. You should respect these headers in your client.

## Client-Side Caching

If you are building an app, we recommend storing fetched hadiths locally.

### Using our SDK

The `@mumin/core` SDK has built-in **Memory Caching**.

```typescript
const client = new MuminClient("KEY", {
  // Enabled by default!
  cache: new MemoryCache(),
});
```

### Manual Caching

If you are not using our SDK, consider using Redis or LocalStorage to store responses for at least 24 hours.

```javascript
// Pseudo-code
const cached = localStorage.getItem('hadith_1')
if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached)

const data = fetch(...)
localStorage.setItem('hadith_1', JSON.stringify(data))
```
