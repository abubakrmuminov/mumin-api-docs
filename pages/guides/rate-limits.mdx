# Rate Limits

To ensure fair usage and system stability, the Mumin API implements rate limits.

## Standard Limits

| Plan           | Rate Limit              |
| :------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Free**       | 60 requests / minute    |
| **Pro**        | 1,000 requests / minute |
| **Enterprise** | Custom                  |

## Headers

Every response includes headers describing your current rate limit status:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests you are allowed to make per minute.
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current time window.
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: The time at which the current rate limit window resets (in UTC epoch seconds).

<Callout type="info">
  If you exceed the limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
</Callout>

## Handling Rate Limits

If you hit a rate limit:

1.  Check the `Retry-After` header to see how many seconds to wait.
2.  Pause your requests for that duration.
3.  Retry the request.

Our official SDKs handle this automatically! 🚀
