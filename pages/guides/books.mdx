# Books & Collections

The Mumin API organizes hadiths into a hierarchy of **Collections**, **Books**, and **Chapters**.

## Collections

A **Collection** is a major compilation of hadiths, such as "Sahih al-Bukhari". We use unique `slugs` to identify them.

| Collection Name   | Slug               |
| :---------------- | :----------------- |
| Sahih al-Bukhari  | `sahih-bukhari`    |
| Sahih Muslim      | `sahih-muslim`     |
| Sunan Abi Dawud   | `sunan-abi-dawud`  |
| Jami` at-Tirmidhi | `jami-at-tirmidhi` |

## Books

Inside each collection, hadiths are grouped into **Books** (e.g., "The Book of Revelation"). Books usually cover a specific topic (Kitab).

## Chapters

Books are further divided into **Chapters** (Bab), which contain specific hadiths related to a sub-topic.

## Numbering Systems

We support multiple numbering systems to help you find hadiths exactly as they appear in printed editions:

- **In-book reference**: The standard index within the book.
- **USC-MSA**: The numbering used by sunnah.com.
